I want this root page route to be the marketing page for the poker engine that I am building. Please create an appealing marketing page that displays the following information, as you see fit. You do not have to copy my wording below.

- this website is designed for the UCSB ACM Development Branch Poker Tournament
- this website allows you to upload the code for your poker bot and automates the game in the backend, while allowing you to view the game in real time.
- we provide an API for your bot to interact with the game and read the game state.
- just sign up, you will get randomly assigned a table and a seat, upload your bot code, and the games will start automatically.
- games are automated such that tables will try to maintain 9 players until the game is out of players.
- the game will automatically start when there are enough players at a table who have uploaded their bots.

Create a simple, clean, and modern design that is easy to navigate. Use a color scheme that is visually appealing and fits the theme of poker. Include sections for the tournament rules, how to upload your bot, and a FAQ section. Make sure to include a call-to-action button for signing up.

Create animated elements to enhance the user experience, such as a parallax poker table background or animated chips that react to user interactions. Ensure the page is responsive and looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.

Please use ShadCN elements wherever you can. Use the terminal to install any elements not already added.
